Reflections and Lessons Learned
ðŸ“š Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to delve into building a CRUD website using React and its hooks. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of front-end development and state management.
ðŸ“š One of the key takeaways was learning how to import and manipulate data from a Mock API using the Axios hook. This skill proved invaluable in handling data fetching and updating within the application.
ðŸ“š Additionally, I implemented global state management for product data using the useContext hook. This provided a centralized approach to accessing and modifying product information across various components, enhancing code organization and reusability.
ðŸš€ Overall, this project was a rewarding learning experience that expanded my knowledge and proficiency in React development and API integration.
